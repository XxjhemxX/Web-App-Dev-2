<!-- Write a function called isOdd that receives 1 parameter:

A Number
And returns a Promise

In this function, determine if the number is odd
If so, resolve the promise with a value of true
Otherwise, reject it with a value of false
Create an array of numbers.

Iterate the array with a for loop
At each iteration, call isOdd function with the number
console.log() the number and the words ‘isOdd  .’ if the number is even
Do nothing if it is even
Remember, you will be calling a promise function, so handle the “returned” values properly
2.  Write an asynchronous function - resolve
Write function called getRandomCharacter that returns a promise
In the promise, write a setTimeout() that will resolve the promise with a random character after 500ms
Invokes the getRandomCharacter function, awaiting the random character, and printing that to the console.
3.  Write an asynchronous function  - reject

Write function called getData that returns a promise
In the promise, write a setTimeout() that will reject the promise with a random value after 500ms
Invokes the getData  function, awaiting the random character, and printing that to the console.
4.  Write an asynchronous function  - reject + resolve

Write function called rejectResolve that returns a promise
In the promise, write a loop that will call settimeout twice. One to reject and one to resolve the promise with a random value after 500ms
Invokes the getData  function, awaiting the random character, and printing that to the console (both for reject and resolve)
